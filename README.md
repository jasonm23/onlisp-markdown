#### A Note to Paul Graham

Dear Paul,

If you have any issues with this work being posted, please let me know
at jasonm23@gmail.com and I will immediately remove this repository.

Please accept my sincere thanks for your writing OnLisp, in my opinion
it is a very significant work, and the most instructive book for
learning Lisp, and of course Lisp Macros.

Many thanks.

Jason
